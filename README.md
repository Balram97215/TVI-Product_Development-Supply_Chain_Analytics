## 🌍 Business Context: High-Velocity Logistics
Transview Enterprise operated as the exclusive warehousing and operations partner for **QNET**, a global direct-selling e-commerce organization handling **thousands of SKUs daily** under strict international fulfillment SLAs.

Despite high demand, the operating environment was fragmented:
- Marketing launched products without logistics alignment  
- Warehouse layouts changed without inventory control visibility  
- Decisions were driven by intuition rather than data  

This disconnect created systemic inefficiencies across the fulfillment pipeline.

---

## ⚠️ Core Challenges

### ⏱️ Fulfillment Delays
- *Pack-to-Load* cycle time stretched to **3 days**
- Repeated SLA breaches led to customer dissatisfaction

### 📦 Dead Stock Accumulation
- Product bundles launched on “gut feel”
- Slow-moving inventory consumed prime warehouse space
- Increased cost of carry and reduced operational flexibility

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach  
### *From Opinion-Based → Evidence-Based Operations*

I applied **Lean Six Sigma rigor** to warehouse execution and **controlled experimentation** to product strategy—creating a shared, data-driven operating language across teams.

---

## 🔧 Initiative 1: Lean Six Sigma — *Pack-to-Load Optimization*

### 🧩 DMAIC Framework

#### 🔹 Define & Measure
Stakeholders initially blamed courier inefficiency.  
I conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on order lifecycle timestamps.

**Insight:**  
The delay was internal.  
⏳ *Order Printed → Truck Loaded* averaged **72 hours** for specific categories.

---

#### 🔹 Analyze
Performed **Gemba Walks** and root cause analysis on the warehouse floor.

**Root Cause Identified:**  
High-velocity (Class A) SKUs were stored in deep racks, forcing excessive picker travel.

---

#### 🔹 Improve (Execution)
Implemented a multi-layered operational redesign:

✅ **ABC Slotting Optimization**
- Class A (Top 20% volume): Placed near packing lines  
- Class C (Low volume): Shifted to deep storage  

✅ **Kanban Deployment**
- Visual triggers for packaging materials  
- Eliminated line stoppages due to stock-outs  

✅ **SOP Standardization**
- Authored standardized SOPs  
- Removed shift-to-shift execution variability  

---

## 🧪 Initiative 2: Strategic Product Experimentation (A/B Testing)

### 🎯 Hypothesis-Driven Product Strategy

#### Problem
Product bundling decisions were influenced by internal bias, increasing inventory risk and warehouse congestion.

---

#### Solution
Introduced a **controlled A/B testing framework** before full-scale product launches.

📊 **Experiment Design**
- Strategy A: Deep Discounting  
- Strategy B: Premium Value-Add Bundling  
- Controlled for comparable customer segments  

📈 **Evaluation Metrics**
- Sell-through rate  
- Margin contribution  
- Return rate  
- Inventory aging impact  

🏁 **Outcome**
Only statistically superior strategies were approved for mass production.

---

## 📊 Initiative 3: Quantitative Stakeholder Communication

In a politically charged environment, I acted as a **neutral data arbiter**.

🔹 **Ad-Hoc Analytics**
- Built standardized Excel reporting templates
- Rapidly addressed executive questions  
  *(e.g., “Why is the Energy Drink SKU stalled?”)*

🔹 **Impact-Based Decisioning**
- Replaced subjective debate with quantified trade-offs  
- Example: Demonstrated that Bundle Strategy A increased picking time by **15%**, enabling leadership to balance revenue goals with operational capacity

---

## 🚀 Impact & Results

### 📉 SLA Recovery
- Eliminated the **3-day packing backlog**
- Restored *Pack-to-Load* performance to **< 24 hours**

### ⚙️ Operational Efficiency
- ABC slotting reduced picker travel distance by **~30%**
- Significantly improved throughput and labor efficiency

### 💰 Revenue Protection
- Prevented launch of underperforming bundles
- Saved capital otherwise tied up in dead stock

### ⚡ Decision Agility
- Reduced executive time-to-insight from **2 days → < 4 hours**
- Enabled rapid corrective action during peak sales cycles
