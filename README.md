# Warehouse Operations Analytics & Process Optimization

**Company:** Transview Enterprise (TVI)  
**Client Context:** Exclusive Management Consultant for QNET (Global Direct Selling E-Commerce)  
**Role:**  Executive Product Development (Supply Chain Analytics)  
**Methodology:** Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC), A/B Testing, Root Cause Analysis  
**Tools:** Excel (Advanced), Kanban, Process Mapping

## 📜 Project Context: High-Velocity Logistics
Transview Enterprise served as the exclusive warehousing and operations partner for **QNET**, a high-volume global direct-selling e-commerce organization. The warehouse operated under intense throughput pressure, with thousands of SKUs moving daily to meet strict international fulfillment SLAs.

Despite scale and demand, operations were fragmented. Functional teams worked in silos—Marketing launched products without Logistics alignment, and Warehouse layout changes occurred without Inventory Control visibility. This lack of coordination resulted in systemic inefficiencies.

---

## ⚠️ The Challenge
Two major operational failures emerged:

### 1. Fulfillment Delays
- “Pack-to-Load” cycle times expanded to **3 days**
- SLA breaches led to downstream customer dissatisfaction and escalations

### 2. Dead Stock Accumulation
- Product bundles were launched based on intuition rather than demand data
- Slow-moving inventory consumed prime warehouse space and increased carrying costs

---

## 🛠️ The Solution: Data Governance & Process Engineering
I transitioned the operating culture from **opinion-based decisions** to **evidence-based execution**, applying Lean Six Sigma rigor to operations and controlled experimentation to strategy.

---

## 1️⃣ Lean Six Sigma Project: *Pack-to-Load Optimization*

### DMAIC Methodology

#### Define & Measure
Initial stakeholder belief attributed delays to courier inefficiencies.  
To validate this assumption, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on order lifecycle timestamps.

**Key Finding:**  
The bottleneck was internal. The time from **Order Printed → Truck Loaded** averaged **72 hours** for select product categories.

---

#### Analyze
I conducted a Root Cause Analysis through **Gemba Walks** on the warehouse floor.

**Root Cause Identified:**  
High-velocity (Class A) SKUs were stored in deep rack locations, forcing packers to traverse excessive distances multiple times per shift.

---

#### Improve (Implementation)
I executed a multi-pronged operational redesign:

- **ABC Slotting Optimization**
  - Class A (Top 20% by volume): Relocated adjacent to packing lines
  - Class C (Low volume): Moved to deep storage

- **Kanban Deployment**
  - Introduced visual Kanban triggers for packaging materials
  - Eliminated line stoppages caused by material shortages

- **SOP Standardization**
  - Authored standardized operating procedures
  - Removed process variability between shift teams

## 2️⃣ Strategic Product Experimentation (A/B Testing)

### Hypothesis-Driven Product Strategy

#### The Problem
Product bundling strategies were influenced by internal bias rather than performance data, increasing inventory risk and warehouse congestion.

---

#### The Solution
I implemented a structured **A/B Testing Framework** to validate product strategies prior to mass rollout.

- **Experiment Design**
  - Compared **Strategy A: Deep Discounting**
  - Versus **Strategy B: Premium Value-Add Bundling**
  - Controlled for comparable customer segments

- **Comparative Metrics**
  - Sell-through rate
  - Margin contribution
  - Return rate
  - Inventory aging impact

- **Implementation**
  - Presented winning strategies using comparative visual dashboards
  - Ensured only data-validated bundles proceeded to full production

---

## 3️⃣ Quantitative Stakeholder Communication (Ad-Hoc Analytics)

In a politically charged environment, I acted as a **neutral data arbiter**.

- **Ad-Hoc Reporting**
  - Built standardized Excel reporting templates
  - Enabled rapid response to urgent executive questions  
    (e.g., “Why is the Energy Drink SKU stalled?”)

- **Impact Analysis**
  - Replaced subjective debate with quantified trade-offs
  - Example: Demonstrated that Bundle Strategy A increased picking time by **15%**, enabling leadership to balance marketing ambition with operational capacity

---

## 🚀 Impact & Results

- **SLA Recovery**
  - Eliminated the 3-day packing backlog
  - Restored *Pack-to-Load* performance to **<24 hours**

- **Operational Efficiency**
  - ABC slotting reduced average picker travel distance by **~30%**
  - Significantly improved warehouse throughput

- **Revenue Protection**
  - A/B testing framework prevented launch of underperforming bundles
  - Saved capital that would have been locked in dead inventory

- **Decision Agility**
  - Reduced executive time-to-insight from **2 days to <4 hours**
  - Enabled faster corrective action during peak sales cycles
