## 🌍 Business Context: High-Velocity Logistics
Transview Enterprise served as the exclusive warehousing and operations partner for **QNET**, a global direct-selling e-commerce organization handling thousands of SKUs daily under strict international fulfillment SLAs.

Despite high demand, operations were fragmented. Marketing launched products without logistics alignment, warehouse layouts changed without inventory control visibility, and decisions were driven by intuition rather than data.

---

## ⚠️ Core Challenges

### ⏱️ Fulfillment Delays
- *Pack-to-Load* cycle times expanded to **3 days**
- SLA breaches caused customer dissatisfaction

### 📦 Dead Stock Accumulation
- Product bundles launched based on gut feel
- Slow-moving inventory consumed valuable warehouse space
- Increased cost of carry and reduced operational flexibility

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach  
### From Opinion-Based → Evidence-Based Operations
I applied **Lean Six Sigma rigor** to warehouse execution and **controlled experimentation** to product strategy—creating a shared, data-driven operating model across teams.

---

## 🔧 Initiative 1: Lean Six Sigma — Pack-to-Load Optimization

### DMAIC Framework

#### Define & Measure
Stakeholders initially attributed delays to courier inefficiency.  
I conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on order lifecycle timestamps.

**Finding:**  
The bottleneck was internal.  
The time from *Order Printed → Truck Loaded* averaged **72 hours** for specific categories.

---

#### Analyze
Performed **Gemba Walks** and root cause analysis on the warehouse floor.

**Root Cause Identified:**  
High-velocity (Class A) SKUs were stored in deep racks, forcing excessive picker travel.

---

#### Improve (Execution)
Implemented a multi-layered operational redesign:

- **ABC Slotting Optimization**
  - Class A (Top 20% volume): Placed near packing lines
  - Class C (Low volume): Shifted to deep storage

- **Kanban Deployment**
  - Visual triggers for packaging materials
  - Eliminated line stoppages due to stock-outs

- **SOP Standardization**
  - Authored standardized SOPs
  - Removed shift-to-shift execution variability
